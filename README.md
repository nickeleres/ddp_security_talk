# ddp_security_talk

Final code I will be building up for my presentation to the Portland Meteor.js group on distributed data protocal on June 11th.
DDP, better known as pub/sub, can increase the security of your web app by strictly revealing the minimum amount of data 
each specific user needs.  Security checks happen on the server and the client is lean.
